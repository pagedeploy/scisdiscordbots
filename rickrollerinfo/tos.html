    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-purple">1. Acceptance of Terms</h4>
    <p>
      By using Rickroller Discord bot (referred to as "the Bot"), you agree to
      comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service ("TOS"). If you do not

    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-purple">2. Purpose and Usage</h4>
    <p>
      The Bot is designed for entertainment purposes and allows users rickroll
      other users in a variety of ways on the Discord platform. The link leads
      to a humorous or unexpected video. Users are solely responsible for how
      they use the Bot and must comply with Discord's own Terms of Service and
      Community Guidelines.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-purple">3. Responsible Use</h4>
    <p>
      You agree not to use the Bot for any malicious, harmful, or abusive
      purposes. You shall not use the Bot to spread harmful content, engage in
      harassment, violate privacy, or participate in any form of cyberbullying.
      The Bot should be used in a light-hearted and friendly manner, respecting
      the feelings and preferences of other users.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-purple">4. Limitations</h4>
    <p>
      The Bot is provided on an "as-is" basis. The Bot's developers and
      operators are not responsible for any consequences that arise from the use
      of the Bot. This includes, but is not limited to, any negative reactions,
      misunderstandings, or disruptions caused by sending the rickroll links.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-purple">5. Modifications to the Bot</h4>
    <p>
      Scinovus Crafted, the developer of the Bot, reserves the right to modify
      or discontinue the Bot at any time without notice. This may include adding
      or removing features, adjusting the behavior of the Bot, or temporarily
      disabling its functionality.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-purple">6. User Data</h4>
    <p>

      limited to user IDs, Discord server information, and usage statistics.
      This data will be handled in accordance with applicable privacy laws and
      the Bot's Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-purple">7. Indemnification</h4>
    <p>
      You agree to hold Scinovus harmless and protect him from any claims,
      damages, liabilities, and expenses arising out of your use of the Bot in

      parties affected by your actions while using the Bot.

      notified of any changes, and continued use of the Bot after changes
      constitutes acceptance of the modified TOS.
