    <h2 class="w3-center">Terms of Service</h2>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-orange">1. Acceptance of Terms</h4>
    <p>
      By using Games Bot Discord bot (referred to as "the Bot"), you agree to
      comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service ("TOS"). If you do not
      agree to these terms, please refrain from using the Bot.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-orange">2. Purpose and Usage</h4>
    <p>
      The Bot is designed to provide users with the ability to play six
      different games within the Discord platform. These games include
      rock-paper-scissors, tic-tac-toe, bowling, flipping a coin, guessing a
      number, and using an 8 ball. Users are solely responsible for how they use
      the Bot and must comply with Discord's own Terms of Service and Community
      Guidelines.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-orange">3. Responsible Use</h4>
    <p>
      You agree to use the Bot responsibly and refrain from using it for any
      malicious, harmful, or abusive purposes. You shall not engage in cheating,
      harassment, or any behavior that violates the fair play principles of the
      games. Users should maintain a respectful and sportsmanlike attitude while
      using the Bot.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-orange">4. Limitations</h4>
    <p>
      The Bot is provided on an "as-is" basis. The Bot's developers and
      operators are not responsible for any consequences that arise from the use
      of the Bot. This includes, but is not limited to, any game outcomes,
      interactions with other users, or any technical issues.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-orange">5. Modifications to the Bot</h4>
    <p>
      Scinovus Crafted, the developer of the Bot, reserves the right to modify
      or discontinue the Bot at any time without notice. This may include adding
      or removing features, adjusting the behavior of the Bot, or temporarily
      disabling its functionality.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-orange">6. User Data</h4>
    <p>
      The Bot itself may collect and store certain user data, including but not
      limited to user IDs, Discord server information, and usage statistics.
      This data will be handled in accordance with applicable privacy laws and
      the Bot's Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-orange">7. Indemnification</h4>
    <p>
      You agree to hold Scinovus harmless and protect him from any claims,
      damages, liabilities, and expenses arising out of your use of the Bot in
      violation of these TOS or applicable laws. This includes claims from third
      parties affected by your actions while using the Bot.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-orange">8. Changes to the TOS</h4>
    <p>
      Scinovus reserves the right to update these TOS at any time. Users will be
      notified of any changes, and continued use of the Bot after changes
      constitutes acceptance of the modified TOS.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-deep-orange">9. Contact Information</h4>
    <p>
      For any questions, concerns, or inquiries regarding the Bot or these TOS,
      you can contact Scinovus via Discord.
